This project uses Python and Matplotlib libraries to create an animation of a sine wave. Users can customize the frequency, amplitude, speed, and center point of the wave's movement, gaining valuable insights into its behavior.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy: Provides efficient numerical operations for manipulating and calculating wave data.
Matplotlib: Enables visualization of the sine wave animation with customizable styles and features.
Project Function:

Animation Loop: The code utilizes an animation loop to update the position and appearance of the sine wave at each frame, creating a smooth and dynamic visual effect.
Time-Dependent Function: Instead of a static sine wave, the code incorporates a time-dependent function that allows the wave's behavior to change over time, creating the illusion of movement.
Customizable Parameters: Users can modify variables like frequency, amplitude, speed, and center point to explore different wave characteristics and observe their impact on the animation.
Applications in Auditory Phonetics:

Sine waves are fundamental building blocks of sound, playing a vital role in understanding and analyzing speech sounds. This project's visualization capabilities can be used to:

Investigate the relationship between pitch and frequency: By adjusting the frequency of the animated sine wave, users can observe its impact on perceived pitch, providing a tangible understanding of this key speech characteristic.
Explore the influence of amplitude on loudness: Changing the amplitude of the wave demonstrates how varying sound intensity affects perceived loudness, highlighting the role of amplitude in speech perception.
Analyze the contribution of overtones to timbre: Complex speech sounds can be modeled by combining multiple sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes. This project's animation capabilities can be used to visualize how these overtones interact and contribute to the unique timbre of different speech sounds.
By exploring the animation and its underlying parameters, users gain a deeper understanding of sine waves and their crucial role in auditory phonetics, paving the way for further research and applications in speech synthesis, communication technologies, and language processing.
